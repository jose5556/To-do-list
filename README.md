# 💡 About the project

This is a simple but functional To-Do List application built with React.
It allows you to manage your daily tasks with a clean and responsive interface.
This project was made to practice component-based design and state management in React.

# 🔍 Overview

The main features of this app are:

    ➕ Add tasks to your to-do list

    ✏️ Edit tasks directly from the list
