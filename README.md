# 💡 About the project

This is a simple but functional To-Do List application built with React.
It allows you to manage your daily tasks with a clean and responsive interface.
This project was made to practice component-based design and state management in React.

# 🔍 Overview


![Screenshot of the Project](/mandelbrot_1.png)

The main features of this app are:

    ➕ Add tasks to your to-do list

    ✏️ Edit tasks directly from the list

    🗑️ Delete tasks when they’re done or no longer needed

The project uses React hooks like useState and useEffect, and is fully functional without any backend — all data is stored in the local state.
🛠️ Usage

All changes happen in real-time and reflect immediately on screen.
